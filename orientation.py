# There are a limited number of valid orientation combinations available,
# assuming each card has two neighboring patterns of the same gender, e.g.,
# north and east are the same gender, west and south are the same gender in the
# initial position
#
# Since the gender of a neighboring edge has to be opposite, the following
# constraints apply (top,left):
#
# ORIENTATION_CONSTRAINTS = [(-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1), \
#                            (0,-1), (1,3), (2,4), \
#                            (3,-1), (4,6), (5,7)]
# where the pairs are (left dependency, top dependency)
# and -1 indicates an edge, i.e., no dpendency
#
# Thus there are 4x2x2x2x1x1x2x1x1 = 64 possible orientation sets.

# unconstrained positions
